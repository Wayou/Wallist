Anyway, there are two ways to use this simple APP.

1. Use locally:
Just download the zip file and extract to a target folder, then open the index.html file with Chrome or any other brwosers that support HTML5 localStorage.

but before you can run it properly, you may run the Chrome with the "--enable-file-access-from-files".

To do that, just right click the icon of Chrome and select "Property". Then add "--enable-file-access-from-files" to the end of the tartget field.

That's really simple. Justs copy all files in the "Wallist" folder to the IIS default site folder in "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\", then you can open the APP in the browser.
Just visit “http://localhost/index.html”.
