How to use:
-------

Anyway, there are two ways to use this simple APP.

1.Use locally:
Just download the zip file and extract to a target folder, then open the index.html file with Chrome or any other brwosers that support HTML5 localStorage.

For now the application not supported in IE when run locally.

> previouslly, there were a XML version of this project, and to run it,
> you may run the Chrome with the "--enable-file-access-from-files".
> To do that, just right click the icon of Chrome and select "Property". Then add "--enable-file-access-from-files" to the end of the tartget field.

2.Run it at server:

That's really simple. Justs copy all files in the "Wallist" folder to the IIS default site folder in "C:\inetpub\wwwroot\", then you can open the APP in the browser.
Just visit “http://localhost/index.html”.
